# Day 1 Exercise 3

Our goal in this exercise is to create methods to read and write data in our database.

Take a look at [adding a model layer](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/javalin/adding-a-model-layer.html).

In `Repositories/UserRepository.java` you will find a `UserRepository` class. This class contains methods to interact with the database.

The method `User.findAll` has been implemented already. Note that the `password` is not included in the returned objects.

## Todo

- [ ] Run `./mvnw test -Dtest=D1E3Tests` to see the failing tests.

- [ ] Implement `User.findById(id)` which returns a single user, found by their ID. Test again.
